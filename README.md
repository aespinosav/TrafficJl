# TrafficJl

##Static Traffic assignment in Julia (based on my python traffic repo)

Ideally this will become a toolbox for static traffic assignment for road networks with multiple 
OD pairs.

This is for my research (PhD project) so while its made freely available,
if you use it and its useful to you please refference me :p
